            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>Dogs are loyal and obey all orders. They put in their biggest effort to accomplish any task given to them. Because they aren't satisfied with being worse than others, a competitive job would suit them well.</p>
            <p>They are also sensitive to details and have strong reasoning skills. They see the dangers of being in a position of high status. This is why they're willing to stay in the background and support others. They'd do well in a behind-the-scenes type of job. Dogs are observant and have strong morals. They judge everyone before deciding if the person is trustworthy. This makes them a good candidate for careers such as referees, lawyers and interviewers.</p>

            <h2>Health and lifestyle</h2> 
            <p>Dogs are healthy overall, but the status of their health often has drastic changes. Though they seem resilient, it actually hides the symptoms that they may have. The smallest colds can put them in bed for days. Be wary of influenza and other contagious diseases during summer and autumn seasons</p>
            <p>They should pay attention to their digestive system during their youth. Their biggest enemy is their unhealthy diet.</p>
            <p>Once in the workforce, Dogs will constantly be busy. The stress will lead to headaches and migraines. In extreme cases, it can even lead to hysteria.</p>
            <p>To create a strong base, Dogs should begin the habit of exercising early on. Taking breaks as needed and relaxing activities such as yoga are recommended.</p>

            <h2>Dogs in the Year of the Tiger (2022)</h2>        
            <p>In the year of 2022, Dogs will turn their luck around from the previous year's hardships and begin to get rid of the obstacles that have been standing in their way. This will be a special year for Dog natives, with gifts of fortune from Tai Sui, and many opportunities across each area of their lives.</p>
            <p>Their career development will be more inspired than previous years, with a marked increase in efficiency, which add up to Dogs being excellently placed for promotions and raises at work. Love will be less stellar, although Dogs may find themselves having too much fun to pursue a committed relationship in 2022. It's alright to enjoy the single lifestyle for a whileâ€”especially after the 2020 and 2021 the whole world has experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic!</p>
