            <h2>Health and lifestyle</h2> 
            <p>Goats are not the healthiest of zodiac animals. They are weaker and their health is influenced by the changes of the seasons.</p>
            <p>However, their mindset is the biggest influence. They are often frustrated and stressed. Because of their detailed characteristic, the smallest problems catch their attention too. This makes them constantly high-strung and worried. It will inevitably lead to illnesses.</p>
            <p>Goats often suffer from colds. Sore throats, headaches and a runny nose are common symptoms. They are also at high risk of heart problems.</p>
            <p>During cold weathers, Goats must make sure to dress warmly. In the summer, they're prone to catching contagious diseases. Eating cold food then is not recommended. Regular exercise is never a bad idea either.</p>
