                    <p>Both Monkeys and Dragons are creative and innovative. But once together, be sure the Monkey doesn't do any small tricks.</p>
                    <p>The Rat's humor and reliability are what attracts the stubborn Dragon. The different personalities complement each other.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>People born in the year of the Dragon have quick paced thinking. They excel at activities that most find mentally exhausting. Because of this, they are suitable for engaging careers. Some fields include the arts, politics and education.</p>
            <p>They might feel insecure and indecisive when working alone. Instead, they're better able to unleash their potential in a team. Dragons are great at planning and coming up with ideas. But they need someone else to help with the miscellaneous details.</p>    
            <p>Dragons are fighters. This is the foundation for success, but can also hinder personal development. Dragons must remember to be more low-key and create lasting relationships.</p>

        <section id="lifestyle">
            <h2>Health and lifestyle</h2> 
            <p>Dragons have a healthy appearance and truly are healthy as well.</p>
            <p>They don't usually get sick, but when they do, it becomes very serious. This is because they are too busy with work to pay attention to their health. They might also think it's no big deal and brush it off. Due to this, minor colds can turn into much more serious illnesses.</p>
            <p>Areas of concern are the circulatory, urinary and digestive systems.</p>
            <p>Most Dragons have stressful careers and are overly sensitive to small details. They can become fatigued, but also suffer from insomnia. Disturbances in social and family relations will heavily affect their mental health.</p>
            <p>For better health, Dragons must remember to keep calm and relaxed. Don't overthink and obsess over small problems. Instead, Dragons should take some time out for themselves. Exercise in nature will help with physical and emotional fatigue.</p>

            <h2>Dragons in the Year of the Tiger (2022)</h2>        
            <p>The overall fortune of Dragons as they enter the Year of the Tiger in 2022 is not very optimistic. Although Dragons are not Fan Tai Sui this year, there are aspects that will prevent them from receiving many blessings over all. For better luck, work extra hard this year in everything you do, because not advancing in the year of 2022 will mean a certain retreat for Dragons, which they will find unbearable.</p>
