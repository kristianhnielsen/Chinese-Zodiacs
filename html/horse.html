            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Horses are full of energy, albeit a bit too much. Both studious and athletic, they are strong believers of chasing after dreams. Rather than wealth and fame, happiness is what motivates them. They expect others to operate at the same speed as them and don't understand why others can't.</p>
            <p>Contradicting characteristics come from the fact that they are ever-changing emotions. They have short tempers and become angry quickly. But once it's over, they forget quickly. They're biggest fault is that they're blind to their own faults.</p>

                    <h3>Men</h3>
                    <p>Men born in the Horse year are independent and crave freedom. They're easygoing and treat everyone sincerely. Their humor and selflessness makes them popular in every group. These Horses are willing to do whatever they can to help others. This is usually a sign of maturity, but these men generally mature slower than others.</p>
                    <p>They also often overestimate themselves. Even if they know what their faults are, it's hard for them to change.</p>

                    <h3>Women</h3>
                    <p>Women born in the Horse year are beautiful and give off a refreshing aura. Sometimes they are gentle ponies, other times they can become wild stallions. Regardless, they are impressive and good at what they do. Motivation and help from others aren't important. As long as they're doing what they like, they will succeed.</p>
                    <p>They can be chatterboxes and have a clear division between like and dislike. However, they are usually indecisive. Rather than having a clear plan, they leave things to fate.</p>

                    <h4>Goat, Tiger, Dog</h4>
                    <p>Horse and Goat are the most compatible. They are attracted by Goat's tenderness, while the Goat's reliance will make a Horse feel content.</p>
                    <p>Tigers are willing to put in effort for a Horse. Their relationship is genuine and true. With a Dog, Horses will find a partner in work and life.</p>

                    <h4>Rat, Ox, Horse</h4>
                    <p>Horses and Rats have clashing personalities. They are the least compatible and their marriage will be painful.</p>
                    <p>With Oxen, there will be obstacles in communication and the relationship is cold. Horses are also incompatible with themselves. They cooperate well, but are too similar to maintain a lasting relationship outside of work.</p>

        <section id="career">
            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>Rather than a simple and routine job, Horses are more suitable for technical and effective work. Some examples include journalism, sales and translating. These jobs require quick reflexes and improvisation. They must also be ready for work at all times. With these, Horses will be in their element.</p>
            <p>Similarly, Horses would enjoy jobs that are constantly changing. This is because Horses constantly change attitudes and feelings towards certain things. They're able to adapt to changing environments. Many times, they already have a plan when others are still trying to figure things out. This makes strong candidates as politicians and critics.</p>    
            <p>Give Horses the freedom they need. There is nothing more painful for them than doing the same thing every day.</p>

            <h2>Health and lifestyle</h2> 
            <p>Horses are always moving. Once they reach one goal, they set off to the next destination without rest.</p>
            <p>Because of their personality, Horses often disrupt their biological clock. This can cause various problems, such as liver and kidney diseases. They should be alert if a cold leads to chest pains.</p>
            <p>To prevent health problems, Horses must calm down their fast-paced rhythm. Do not ignore minor symptoms, as they can worsen into serious illnesses.</p>
            <p>Overall, Horses are naturally healthy. But it can be worrisome if they force themselves on without proper rest. Pulling all-nighters is a habit and they continue working even during holidays. Horses must create and stick to a more manageable routine if they wish to maintain their health.</p>

            <h2>Horses in the Year of the Tiger (2022)</h2>        
            <p>Entering 2022, Horses will be rid of the influence of Fan Tai Sui in 2021, so their overall fortune will be on a steady climb in this year. Many stars will bless them with stellar career achievements if they are able to harness their energy and work hard. A meteoric rise is possible if they play their cards right and recognition and public praise are more than likely.</p>
            <p>At the same time, there will also be aspects less favorable for this zodiac sign which they will need to guard against. Most of all, Horses will be prone to even more emotional instability than previous years. They will feel suspicious of people around them, and their personal relationships can suffer damage as a result. If Horses are not careful, they could end 2022 lonely winners with no one to share the joys of their achievements with.</p>
