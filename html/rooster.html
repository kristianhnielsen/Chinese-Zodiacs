            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Roosters are serious in their work. They are straightforward and decisive in their actions. They'll directly criticize what they see unfit and are perfectionists. They are logical and good at managing teams.</p>
            <p>Family is a refuge and paradise for them. They wish for a large familyâ€”it means that there are more people to encourage and support them.</p>
            <p>No matter how difficult something is, they won't give up. But if someone is blocking their path, they will reveal their fierce side. They are terrifying if angered and get into arguments easily. Even if they lose, they'll use various methods to convince others into their side.</p>
            <p>Roosters really just need loved ones to validate them and encouragement to find themselves.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>Roosters don't actually care about money. They gain it quickly and spend it quickly as well.</p>
            <p>But Roosters are very serious and earnest with their work. They have professional skills and courage. They make smart choices, but instead of being more careful with important decisions, they often botch them. They also don't like being ordered around.</p>    
            <p>Careers that fit Roosters are ones that give them enough space and freedom. It must be difficult enough to challenge them and not let their talent go to waste. Some choices are politicians, diplomats, tour guides and fashion designers.</p>

            <h2>Health and lifestyle</h2> 
            <p>Overall, Roosters have average health. This means that there aren't any serious illnesses, but small problems are inevitable.</p>
            <p>Roosters must not be careless. They aren't the healthiest naturally and outside factors can affect their health greatly.</p>
            <p>Being picky eaters is common in all zodiacs, but Roosters are especially so. They are even picky with the food they like to eat. Their diets are influenced by their mood too. Since they often have mood swings, this can lead to problems in the digestive system.</p>
            <p>The best way for Roosters to maintain their health is to fix their bad habits and oversensitive personality.</p>

            <h2>Roosters in the Year of the Tiger (2022)</h2>        
            <p>The year of 2022 will present fluctuating fortunes for Roosters. They can expect improvements in career and personal finance, especially with the help of generous higher-ups, making this quite a successful year for Roosters in terms of money and status. What could only be dreamed of in previous years will become possible this year, such as a rapid promotion accompanied by a huge increase in salary, or the purchase of real estates that they have saved up for over the last few years.</p>
            <p>At the same time, jealous competitors may lurk in the shadows, waiting to supplant Roosters this year, presenting some difficulties and obstacles at work. Their finances may take a dent on account of this. Love will not go as smoothly either, with external factors interfering with Rooster's own firm and steady heart. </p>
            <p>Overall, the year of 2022 will be a rewarding if at times difficult year. At the end of it, Roosters are likely to find themselves miles ahead compared to how they ended 2021, both in worldly gains and in their personal growth and maturation.</p>
