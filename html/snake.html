            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Snakes are humorous and sophisticated. They don't like small talk or thinking about small everyday problems.</p>
            <p>In a chaotic environment, they are the eye of the storm. Snakes are able to hold their ground and calmly think of solutions.</p>
            <p>They are always making new plans and follow them without relying on others' input. They're usually correct, but this also comes from a distrust of others. You cannot judge a Snake by its cover. Their slow and lazy talking hides their fast-paced thinking. Behind their calmness, they are alert and observant.</p>

                    <h3>Men</h3>
                    <p>Men born in the Snake year are mysterious and experienced. They are gentle and know how to say the right things. In an awkward situation, they can always be depended on to crack a joke.</p>
                    <p>Different from others, these men believe in romance. They often give their significant other sweet surprises. They are also creative and empathetic.</p>
                    <p>However, they crave to be the center of attention and easily become jealous. This makes it harder for them to socialize.</p>

                    <h3>Women</h3>
                    <p>Women born in the Snake year are graceful and elegant. They are beautiful, both inside and out. Their confidence is manifested in their high fashion and appreciation for classic art.</p>
                    <p>They are always thinking ahead, though they often act as if they don't care. They have high standards for friends. They desire for wealth and power. With their intelligence and skills, success shouldn't be a problem.</p>
                    <p>However, their greatest fault is their jealousy. They cannot stand seeing others who are more successful. This becomes motivation to work harder and become better though.</p>

                    <h4>Monkey, Rooster, Ox</h4>
                    <p>Monkey and Snake make up the most compatible pair. They have similar personalities, but one is yin and the other is yang. Therefore, they can reach harmony.</p>
                    <p>Snake and Rooster seem very different, but they are quite compatible. A Rooster's ability and taste are what attracts a Snake.</p>
                    <p>They fit well with Oxen as well. A Snake gives Oxen warmth and romance, and receives a reliable anchor in return.</p>

                    <h4>Tiger, Pig</h4>
                    <p>It's hard for a Snake and Tiger to sympathize and understand each other. The relationship will be full of suspect and coldness.</p>
                    <p>Snakes are also incompatible with Pigs. They can work well together, but there isn't much trust in a relationship.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>Snakes will do well in jobs that require quick thinking and fast reaction speeds.</p>
            <p>They are great improvisers. They will do well in competitive fields such as emcees and competitive sports.</p>    
            <p>They also have their own unique methods. No matter what others say, they'll stick to their ways. For people like this, management and leadership positions are the best. When the team is confused, they'll be able to guide their team members onto the right direction.</p>
            <p>Because of this, they are not fit for careers where they cannot express their opinions. Routine and standardized jobs are not for them.</p>
            <p>Still, Snakes must learn to listen. Consider the thoughts of others and combine it with their own ideas. This is the way to long-lasting success in the workplace.</p>

            <h2>Health and lifestyle</h2> 
            <p>Overall, a Snake's health is influenced by their genes. Their parents' health is what decides their own health.</p>
            <p>However, Snakes are extremely picky eaters. They will stuff themselves with their favorites and not even consider a balanced diet. This will inevitably lead to some health problems.</p>
            <p>Snakes also keep their complaints inside. The bottled up emotions can cause stress and anxiety. Stress directly relates to the health of a Snake's heart, blood vessels and other organs. Women also need to pay attention to their urinary system.</p>

            <h2>Snakes in the Year of the Tiger (2022)</h2>        
            <p>Snakes will not be blessed with stellar fortunes in 2022. This is a year of “punishing” aspects for Snake natives, as it is a year of Fan Tai Sui, likely with frequent interferences and chaos, leading to various tests for Snakes. But fear not, because higher-ups will continue to favor Snakes with this year's stars; therefore, work hard and stay humble—nothing to worry about as long as you do.</p>
            <p>In particular, career and wealth will offer many opportunities this year, but Snakes may be inclined to be careless with their money. That would be a big mistake, especially in 2022. Health is another area to watch out for, while love isn't likely to bring any satisfaction.</p>
