            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>People born in years of the Tiger are fiercely independent and possess strong self-esteem. They like to act alone and are not very gregarious. They are most likely optimistic and enthusiastic by nature, and always seem to have endless energy, especially at work. Their energetic presence and intense eyes are the greatest charm of Tiger natives. Their vitality is apparent to anyone at a glance, and people are instinctively drawn to this larger than life quality in them.</p>
            <p>Tigers are lively and cheerful, and they love freedom and independence. They are a zodiac sign that absolutely must have their personal space. Tigers usually have a keen sense of justice. When faced with injustices, whether against themselves or others, you can be sure Tigers will not stand aside. However, Tigers may also appear unrefined or thoughtless in the way they handle things. In a less developed person, these traits can easily turn into ignorance or foolhardiness.</p>
            <p>In general, Tigers possess great tenacity. They are loyal, quick and the center of attention in everything they do. However, a king needs a domain to be truly in possession of their power. For any Tiger, male or female, their ambition will come before they allow themselves a break to enjoy other parts of life.</p>

                    <h3>Men</h3>
                    <p>Tiger men are talented and ambitious. They are unlikely to stay in a work environment that does not allow them to develop freely for long. Very likely, Tiger men will work for a large company for a few years before setting up their own shop. They are charismatic although rarely gregarious. They are trusted leaders, but rarely friends or confidants. It will be easy for them to move up in any career path they may choose, as long as it presents the potential for independent decision-making. These are serious and earnest men who take their work and life seriously and work tirelessly until they reach their goal.</p>
                    <p>The same dedication applies to their love life—if they are in love with a woman, they will work earnestly to win her affection before settling down to a serious commitment with her. Once that happens, Tigers will remain a loyal partner. Extramarital affairs are almost impossible for these majestic and diligent men.</p>

                    <h3>Women</h3>
                    <p>Female Tigers are intelligent and strong to the point of domineering. To some, they may appear entirely unfeminine. In the workplace, they can appear brash. In reality, however, Tigers possess positive traits that spell success both at work and home. In the professional setting, Tiger women are bold and decisive. They are fearless and never hesitate to take on a leadership role—why should they? They know themselves to be the best.</p>
                    <p>It is believed by some that Tiger women are arrogant and temperamental, therefore unlikely to find satisfaction in home and family life. This statement is not unreasonable, but more because ancient cultures like China's tended to believe a woman's place was in the home. In the modern day, that is no longer true, and anyone who can handle their dominant first impression will find a dedicated and strong woman underneath their tough exterior—an equal match for any man outstanding enough for these independent ladies to consider as a potential mate.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>Tigers are ambitious to a fault, but don't mistake that for greed or desire for financial rewards alone. On the contrary, Tigers usually hold some spiritual belief that is higher than money. Their ambition is not simply a means to secure their financial future. Indeed, often their highest pursuit exists only in ideals that are impossible to fully realize in the real world, but that does not mean that Tigers will stop trying.</p>
            <p>To their advantage, Tigers are skilled at analyzing situations and gaining unique insights that they can then turn into opportunities. They are decisive and bold, like any natural leader should be. They do not like mundane work, but thrive in an environment in which they must reinvent themselves daily. What may be anxiety-producing for others, Tigers crave in order to satisfy their abundant energy and entrepreneurial bent. They believe their hard work will pay off.</p>
            <p>Politics, business and investing are areas Tigers may choose as naturally as a fish chooses to remain in water. These sectors offer them the chance to play out their strengths. Competitive sports where Tigers have the opportunity to push themselves past their personal limit each day are also welcomed. Otherwise, Tigers may choose to go into business for themselves. Outdoor and sports equipment stores may be a wise entrepreneurial venture, as it would be satisfying as an entrepreneur while indulging in a sense of adventure.</p>      
            <p>Lastly, Tigers are resolute and can often also be rebellious. They love to change the status quo and break apart traditions. Therefore, they could also work well in the research and development department to develop new markets or discover new ways of conducting any business. Ultimately, as long as their need to be independent and adventurous is satisfied, Tigers should thrive in any career.</p>

            <h2>Rats in the Year of the Tiger (2022)</h2>        
            <p>It is the Year of the Tiger in 2022, Tiger's Ben Ming Nian. It is therefore their year of Fan Tai Sui—offending the powerful yearly god that governs an entire year in Chinese culture. This is unfortunate for Tigers in Chinese astrology, which believes that a person's Ben Ming Nian is the year they will likely suffer setbacks and misunderstandings at the very least, possibly even meet with disasters on a more serious scale.</p>
            <p>But fear not, because there are ways to combat this turn of bad luck, and if you work along with the flow of fortune and destiny, you should be able to overcome any serious challenges and come out more or less unscathed from the year.</p>
            <p>Check out our article on Tai Sui for a list of things you can do this year to ward off Tai Sui's wrath in 2022, and ask for favors and blessings from this powerful god. Be sure to start preparing before Chinese New Year before February 1, 2022, to get a jump start!</p>
