            <h2>The Great Race</h2>

            <hr>
            
            <p>An ancient folk story called the "Great Race" tells that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Emperor">Jade Emperor</a> decreed that the years on the calendar would be named for each animal in the order they reached him. <br>To get there, the animals would have to cross a river.</p>
            <p>The strong <strong>Cat</strong> and the Rat were not good at swimming, but they were both quite intelligent. They decided that the best and fastest way to cross the river was to hop on the back of the <strong>Ox</strong>. The <strong>Ox</strong>, being kindhearted and naive, agreed to carry them both across. As the <strong>Ox</strong> was about to reach the other side of the river, the <strong>Rat</strong> pushed the <strong>Cat</strong> into the water. The <strong>Rat</strong> jumping off the <strong>Ox</strong> right before the finish line in order to finish first. It was named as the first animal of the zodiac calendar. The <strong>Ox</strong> had to settle in second place.</p>
            <p>The third one to come, was the <strong>Tiger</strong>. Even though it was strong and powerful, it explained to the Jade Emperor that the currents were pushing him downstream.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, from a distance came a thumping sound, and the <strong>Rabbit</strong> arrived. It explained how it crossed the river: by jumping from one stone to another, in a nimble fashion. Halfway through, it almost lost the race, but it was lucky enough to grab hold of a floating log that later washed him to shore. For that, it became the fourth animal in the zodiac cycle.</p>
            <p>In fifth place, was the flying <strong>Dragon</strong>. The Jade Emperor was wondering why such a swift airborne creature such as the <strong>Dragon</strong> did not come in first. The <strong>Dragon</strong> explained that it had to stop by a village and brought rain for all the people, and therefore it was held back. Then, on its way to the finish, it saw the helpless <strong>Rabbit</strong> clinging onto a log, so it did a good deed and gave a puff of breath to the poor creature so that it could land on the shore. The Jade Emperor was astonished by the <strong>Dragon</strong>'s good nature, and it was named as the fifth animal.</p>
            <p>As soon as it had done so, a galloping sound was heard, and the <strong>Horse</strong> appeared. Hidden on the <strong>Horse</strong>'s hoof was the <strong>Snake</strong>, whose sudden appearance gave it a fright, thus making it fall back and giving the <strong>Snake</strong> the sixth spot while the <strong>Horse</strong> placed seventh.</p>
            <p>After a while, the <strong>Goat</strong>, <strong>Monkey</strong>, and <strong>Rooster</strong> came to the heavenly gate. With combined efforts, they managed to arrive to the other side. The <strong>Rooster</strong> found a raft, and the <strong>Monkey</strong> and the <strong>Goat</strong> tugged and pulled, trying to get all the weeds out of the way. The Jade Emperor was pleased with their teamwork and decided to name the <strong>Goat</strong> as the eighth animal followed by the <strong>Monkey</strong> and then the <strong>Rooster</strong>.</p>
            <p>The eleventh animal placed in the zodiac cycle was the <strong>Dog</strong>. Although it should have been the best swimmer and runner, it spent its time to play in the water. Though his explanation for being late was because it needed a good bath after a long spell. For that, it almost did not make it to the finish line.</p>
            <p>Right when the Emperor was going to end the race, an "oink" sound was heard: it was the <strong>Pig</strong>. The <strong>Pig</strong> felt hungry in the middle of the race, so it stopped, ate something, and then fell asleep. After it awoke, it finished the race in twelfth place and became the last animal to arrive.</p>
            <p id="cat">The <strong>Cat</strong> eventually drowned and failed to be in the zodiac. It is said that this is the reason cats always hunt rats and also hate water as well.</p>
