            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Monkeys' most defining trait is their intelligence. As children, they win awards and the praises of teachers. As adults, they gain professional recognition and make great leaders.</p>
            <p>Due to this, it's understandable that they can be arrogant. They're often disrespectful and self-centered when making decisions. Monkeys become jealous easily, especially when others are doing better than them. They are awfully competitive, which is both positive and negative.</p>
            <p>However, they view everyone as teachers. They're willing to listen to critique and learn from their mistakes. They are calm and logical thinkers. Monkeys are always able to triumph and be the final winner.</p>

                    <p>However, they can be problematic too. It's hard for them to persevere since their interests are always changing. They're the typical opportunist and can't maintain long-term relationships.</p>

                    <p>The relationship between Monkeys and Snakes is very extreme. They are either the most compatible or clash the strongest. They have similar personalities, but one is yin and the other is yang.</p>
                    <p>Rats are able to cheer Monkeys up when they're feeling down. When they're together, it's always full of laughter.</p>
                    <p>Dragons can also bring joy to Monkeys. They're attractive to Monkeys too as a strong competitor.</p>

                    <p>Monkeys and Tigers clash strongly. They are suspicious of each other and fight constantly.</p>
                    <p>Pigs don't have the same life goals and interests as Monkeys. It's difficult to communicate and relationships don't last long.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>Monkeys are never satisfied and want to try everything. This makes them suitable for challenging and risky careers. Some choices are professional athletes and stockbrokers.</p>
            <p>They're also cool-headed and will do well in fields that require logical thinking. Monkeys are knowledgeable in many topics and are multi-faceted. They can deal with complicated problems. Detectives, editors and lawyers are good fits.</p>    
            <p>Because Monkeys aren't the best at sticking to one thing, it can seem like they're irresponsible. This effects the impression they give higher ups. Therefore, being a freelancer is another option for Monkeys. They can choose many short-term jobs that fit their abilities and interests.</p>

            <h2>Health and lifestyle</h2> 
            <p>Monkeys don't have much to worry about in regards to health.</p>
            <p>They have some bad habits though. Their active personality makes them accident prone and can hurt themselves. It often takes their bodies a while to get accustomed to changing seasons as well. Colds and sore throats are common.</p>
            <p>Monkeys should also take care of their mental health. They care too much about what others think and can easily become depressed. Connecting with friends and family and exercise are very beneficial!</p>

            <h2>Monkeys in the Year of the Tiger (2022)</h2>        
            <p>The year of 2022 will be the year of Fan Tai Sui for Monkey, so their fortunes will be turbulent all year. Just as Tiger and Monkey do not make a good couple, so in a year of Tiger, as in 2022, Monkeys may have to weather some intense storms, in which everything looks unpredictable and will test Monkey's resilience in life.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, years of a zodiac sign's Fan Tai Sui are also years they should look for change, and if they play their cards right, Monkeys may not only exit the year unscathed, but may indeed find the turbulence they have had to endure were opportunities for positive change and transformation.</p>
            <p>Remember that in years of Fan Tai Sui, start preparing early items that will bring you luck. Start by purchasing a set of red underwear to put on before the Chinese New Year that starts on February 1st and read our guide on Fan Tai Sui for a more extensive list of what to do to win favor with the powerful god of Tai Sui.</p>
