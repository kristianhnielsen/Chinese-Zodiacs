            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Pigs might not stand out in a crowd. But they are very realistic. Others may be all talk and no action. Pigs are the opposite.</p>
            <p>Though not wasteful spenders, they will let themselves enjoy life. They love entertainment and will occasionally treat themselves. They are a bit materialistic, but this is motivation for them to work hard. Being able to hold solid objects in their hands gives them security.</p>
            <p>They are energetic and are always enthusiastic, even for boring jobs. If given the chance, they will take positions of power and status. They believe that only those people have the right to speak, and that's what they want.</p>

                    <h3>Men</h3>
                    <p>Men born in the Pig year are optimistic and gentle. They are very focused. Once they decide on a goal, they'll put everything into it.</p>
                    <p>They are not the best with money. Though cool-headed, they are also gullible. They trust others easily and are often scammed. This can cause them to lose a fortune.</p>
                    <p>These men are also quiet. They love learning but don't really know how to put their knowledge into words. They're not conversationalists, but treat everyone warmly. This results in a large social circle. Whenever they run into difficulties, there are always people who stand up to help. Though people will lie to them, more will love them.</p>

                    <p>Women born in the Pig year are full of excitement. They attend social events whenever possible and treat everyone genuinely. Combined with their easygoing personality, they gain everyone's trust.</p>
                    <p>However, they are sometimes over-friendly. In their excitement, they can forget to give others personal space.</p>
                    <p>They also have good fortune with wealth. As long as they keep at it, the efforts will not go to waste. Though they don't start with an advantage, their hard work will keep money flowing in.</p>
                    <p>At home, they are highly organized. If the room is messy, they'd stay up the entire night to clean it up. These women love children too. Playing with children is one of the things that bring them the greatest joy.</p>

                    <p>Pigs are the most compatible with Tigers. The brave Tiger gives Pigs the security they need.</p>
                    <p>The Rabbit will be attracted by the Pig's intelligence and warmth. With the Goat, there are many common interests and topics.</p>

                    <p>Pigs and Snakes have clashing personalities and are the least compatible. They have biases against each other and can't compromise. It's hard to get along with Monkeys as well. The relationship is full of tension.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>Pigs are gentle and rarely lose their temper. Even when they do, it's never a dramatic commotion. They'll always try to compromise and settle things quickly. Because their goal in life is for everyone to live in harmony, they are suitable for careers related to charity and fundraisers.</p>
            <p>They are also very tolerant and understanding. If someone makes a mistake, they'll try to help the person fix it. They are patient and want the best for everyone. This makes them great teachers and coaches.</p>    
            <p>If Pigs are interested in business, they should be braver. Take some risks in investments, but to an extent. After some small obstacles, the road to wealth would be smooth. Real estate is a good option for these Pigs.</p>

            <h2>Health and lifestyle</h2> 
            <p>Pigs mostly have a great build and a resilient body. They are always spirited, as if they will never run out of energy. Their natural health is something Pigs are proud of.</p>
            <p>But sometimes they can be overconfident and overlook some minor symptoms. If neglected for too long, even the smallest things can become grave.</p>
            <p>In addition, Pigs lead very busy lives. Even if they don't feel tired, they should still remember to take breaks. Seasonal changes have an effect on Pigs' health too. They may be at risk for respiratory diseases. Unhealthy diets can lead to diabetes, high cholesterol and heart problems too.</p>
            <p>Pigs are never one to give in to difficulties. This is a positive trait in the workplace, but might not be here. For good health, Pigs must learn to take small illnesses seriously and get regular checkups.</p>

            <h2>Pigs in the Year of the Tiger (2022)</h2>        
            <p>Pigs will be blessed by Tai Sui in 2022, but unfortunately, other aspects may cause a bit of trouble despite this. As such, Pigs can look forward to an abundance of good luck this year, which may be punctuated by periods of instability and changeable fortune.</p>
            <p>The way to deal with this is to prepare for everything, and to never be in a hurryâ€”pressure like that never sits well with Pigs. Take an optimistic approach as you usually do toward life, with plenty of backup options for the things that are important to you, and everything will likely work out in your favor.</p>
