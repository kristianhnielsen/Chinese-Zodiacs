            <p>Rats also pay attention to fine detail. They are fit for technical work, such as engineering and architecture.</p>
            <p>They are alert, but have a lack of courage. This makes them unsuitable as police officers, entrepreneurs or other leadership and political positions. Although Rats make good financial decisions, they should be careful not to invest with a close friend. It will not only cause money problems, but also affect the friendship.</p>

        <section id="lifestyle">
            <h2>Health and lifestyle</h2> 
            <p>Since childhood, Rats have frail health. They have energetic personalities, but tire quickly. They catch colds often, but thankfully do not have serious illnesses.</p>
            <p>They are sensitive to change in temperature. Not only is cold weather unbearable for them, they also can't stand hot weather. But despite seeming weak and not being able to perform hard physical work, they enjoy longevity.</p>
            <p>Rats can eat anything, whether they are delicacies or plain food. However, they should pay attention to their diet. Many times, they will get too into work and forget to eat. Going long periods without food and suddenly bingeing cause problems in their digestive system. Enemies of their health also include smoking and drinking habits.</p>
            <p>For a healthy life, Rats must remember to eat breakfast, do moderate exercise and remain cheerful.</p>

            <h2>Rats in the Year of the Tiger (2022)</h2>        
            <p>The year of 2021 is likely one of some turbulence for people born in years of the Rat. Fortunately, the lunar year of 2022, which will start on February 1, is likely to be a much better year for this group. The bad luck you experienced in 2021 will be completely washed away and replaced by happiness and joy in many aspects of life.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Rat natives may be prone to impulsive behavior in 2022, with a penchant for being nosy. Make sure to curb this tendency in yourself and learn to control your temper in order to enjoy your luck in 2022 to the fullest.</p>
