            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>People born in years of the Tiger are fiercely independent and possess strong self-esteem. They like to act alone and are not very gregarious. They are most likely optimistic and enthusiastic by nature, and always seem to have endless energy, especially at work. Their energetic presence and intense eyes are the greatest charm of Tiger natives. Their vitality is apparent to anyone at a glance, and people are instinctively drawn to this larger than life quality in them.</p>
            <p>Tigers are lively and cheerful, and they love freedom and independence. They are a zodiac sign that absolutely must have their personal space. Tigers usually have a keen sense of justice. When faced with injustices, whether against themselves or others, you can be sure Tigers will not stand aside. However, Tigers may also appear unrefined or thoughtless in the way they handle things. In a less developed person, these traits can easily turn into ignorance or foolhardiness.</p>
            <p>In general, Tigers possess great tenacity. They are loyal, quick and the center of attention in everything they do. However, a king needs a domain to be truly in possession of their power. For any Tiger, male or female, their ambition will come before they allow themselves a break to enjoy other parts of life.</p>

                    <h3>Men</h3>
                    <p>Tiger men are talented and ambitious. They are unlikely to stay in a work environment that does not allow them to develop freely for long. Very likely, Tiger men will work for a large company for a few years before setting up their own shop. They are charismatic although rarely gregarious. They are trusted leaders, but rarely friends or confidants. It will be easy for them to move up in any career path they may choose, as long as it presents the potential for independent decision-making. These are serious and earnest men who take their work and life seriously and work tirelessly until they reach their goal.</p>
                    <p>The same dedication applies to their love life—if they are in love with a woman, they will work earnestly to win her affection before settling down to a serious commitment with her. Once that happens, Tigers will remain a loyal partner. Extramarital affairs are almost impossible for these majestic and diligent men.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Women</h3>
                    <p>Female Tigers are intelligent and strong to the point of domineering. To some, they may appear entirely unfeminine. In the workplace, they can appear brash. In reality, however, Tigers possess positive traits that spell success both at work and home. In the professional setting, Tiger women are bold and decisive. They are fearless and never hesitate to take on a leadership role—why should they? They know themselves to be the best.</p>
                    <p>It is believed by some that Tiger women are arrogant and temperamental, therefore unlikely to find satisfaction in home and family life. This statement is not unreasonable, but more because ancient cultures like China's tended to believe a woman's place was in the home. In the modern day, that is no longer true, and anyone who can handle their dominant first impression will find a dedicated and strong woman underneath their tough exterior—an equal match for any man outstanding enough for these independent ladies to consider as a potential mate.</p>

                    <h4>horse, Dog, pig</h4>
                    <p><strong>Tiger and Horse</strong></p>
                    <p>This pair will have a lot in common. Both of you will have plenty of energy, and you will most likely enjoy moving toward a common goal together. Together, you can make continuous progress and create a better life. The man will be very active and confident in doing things, while the woman is a lively, cheerful and naturally charming person. Tiger will also be quite responsible for the family, so this marriage will be characterized by a clear division of duties. Neither of you will be lazy in your unremitting effort to build a solid home and amass wealth and security as a couple. You are destined for a joyous and abundant life together.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Tiger and Dog</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a naturally good match, as both partners are idealists who are kind and charitable. In this area, they will be able to give each other the understanding and the support they need. As a married couple, this pair will enjoy physical and mental peace—a feeling of being at ease in their partner's presence. Both are likely to become even more generous and humble as their relationship matures. TIger can be temperamental, which does not scare Dog, who excels at using diplomacy to comfort the too-impulsive Tiger. This is a perfect pair in many ways.</p>        
                    <p><strong>Tiger and Pig</strong></p>
                    <p>Tiger and Pig are a pair that can motivate each other. Tiger is cheerful and high-spirited, making the man feel deeply attracted to his mate. Pig is kind-hearted and generous toward others, making compassionate Tiger quite fond of them. They will know how to attract each other's attention and how to please each other in every aspect of life. As long as you fall for each other naturally, the foundation of your relationship will prove quite solid over the years. Even if one partner falls short of expectations in one area, this shortcoming will likely be ignored by their mate. This will be a very forgiving couple indeed.</p>

                    <h4>Monkey, Snake</h4>
                    <p><strong>Tiger and Monkey</strong></p>
                    <p>These two zodiac signs don't really belong to the same world. Tiger is strong-willed and ambitious, often incapable of listening to others' ideas. They may even resort to violence in the wrong pairing. Monkeys can also be temperamental and unwilling to back down. As a couple, they will fight and quarrel over everything, neither willing to take a step back or make up. Both will likely be selfish toward their partner, with their entire attention on themselves and their own lives. This couple will most likely not last for very long, with a hasty marriage inevitably ending in divorce.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Tiger and Snake</strong></p>
                    <p>It will be difficult for this pairing to come together. They are almost opposite each other in temperament, and won't find it easy to understand the other person. Tiger is passionate and direct, while Snake is cautious and suspicious. Snake will find Tiger overpowering, while Tiger will find Snake difficult to get to know. Without the ability to communicate and understand each other, this pairing is destined to fail eventually.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>Tigers are ambitious to a fault, but don't mistake that for greed or desire for financial rewards alone. On the contrary, Tigers usually hold some spiritual belief that is higher than money. Their ambition is not simply a means to secure their financial future. Indeed, often their highest pursuit exists only in ideals that are impossible to fully realize in the real world, but that does not mean that Tigers will stop trying.</p>
            <p>To their advantage, Tigers are skilled at analyzing situations and gaining unique insights that they can then turn into opportunities. They are decisive and bold, like any natural leader should be. They do not like mundane work, but thrive in an environment in which they must reinvent themselves daily. What may be anxiety-producing for others, Tigers crave in order to satisfy their abundant energy and entrepreneurial bent. They believe their hard work will pay off.</p>
            <p>Politics, business and investing are areas Tigers may choose as naturally as a fish chooses to remain in water. These sectors offer them the chance to play out their strengths. Competitive sports where Tigers have the opportunity to push themselves past their personal limit each day are also welcomed. Otherwise, Tigers may choose to go into business for themselves. Outdoor and sports equipment stores may be a wise entrepreneurial venture, as it would be satisfying as an entrepreneur while indulging in a sense of adventure.</p>      
            <p>Lastly, Tigers are resolute and can often also be rebellious. They love to change the status quo and break apart traditions. Therefore, they could also work well in the research and development department to develop new markets or discover new ways of conducting any business. Ultimately, as long as their need to be independent and adventurous is satisfied, Tigers should thrive in any career.</p>

            <h2>Rats in the Year of the Tiger (2022)</h2>        
            <p>It is the Year of the Tiger in 2022, Tiger's Ben Ming Nian. It is therefore their year of Fan Tai Sui—offending the powerful yearly god that governs an entire year in Chinese culture. This is unfortunate for Tigers in Chinese astrology, which believes that a person's Ben Ming Nian is the year they will likely suffer setbacks and misunderstandings at the very least, possibly even meet with disasters on a more serious scale.</p>
            <p>But fear not, because there are ways to combat this turn of bad luck, and if you work along with the flow of fortune and destiny, you should be able to overcome any serious challenges and come out more or less unscathed from the year.</p>
            <p>Check out our article on Tai Sui for a list of things you can do this year to ward off Tai Sui's wrath in 2022, and ask for favors and blessings from this powerful god. Be sure to start preparing before Chinese New Year before February 1, 2022, to get a jump start!</p>
